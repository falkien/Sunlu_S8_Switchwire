# Sunlu_S8_Switchwire_Conversion

You will find here all the files needed to upgrade your Sunlu S8 to a Voron Switchwire. This is an on-going project, far from being finished so be patient. <br />
<br />
This will hopefully have everything that you need to do a conversion. It has taken me several months to get this up and running and I will also be updating this as I go, so excuse the gramar and layout as I am new to github.<br />
