Update the skirt to the mesh skirt. These are taken from the flat mesh skirts from Thejiral on printables. Front and back are from the 250mm trident. 
There are 2 different versions the origiinals and the ones that have 274.1mm in them. These are reduced by 99.75% from the originals. The originals can fit but it VERY tight. 
The sides are the 350mm trident sides reduced by about 4.5%. I have 2 differnet versions I chose the 354.18mm ones as they left a little wiggle room. If you wish to resize 
these yourself take the file (Trident-original-Side-skirt-V2-350_2x_RESIZE.3mf) and unlock the scaling lock and resize the X down around 94-95%. I know this is the is not the 
ideal way to do this, but as I have stated elseware I am no good at 3d CAD programs. I will also add a 40mm fan insert for the sides since I am not runing 60mm fans on this setup.
