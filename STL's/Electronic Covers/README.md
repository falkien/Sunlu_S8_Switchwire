Update the skirt to the mesh skirt. These are taken from the flat mesh skirts from Thejiral on printables. Front and back are from the 250mm trident and the sides are the 350mm trident sides reduced by about 4.5%. I have 2 differnet versions I chose the 354.18mm ones as they left a little wiggle room. If you wish to resize these yourself take the file (Trident-original-Side-skirt-V2-350_2x_RESIZE.3mf) and unlock the scaling lock and resize the X down around 94-95%. The is not the ideal way to do this, but as I have stated elseware I am no good at 3d CAD programs. I will also add a 40mm fan insert for the sides since I am not runing 60mm fans on this setup. The Front skirt could be reduced to about 99%, I just sanded it down just a little to make it fit.
